  ## Usage 
  
  *Instructions and examples for use:*
  
  User can choose to first visit as guest however to see more than just the high level thread topic/image the user will need to create an account and login. Once logged in the user can retrieve their location in order to view any threads that may have been posted near enough to them. Users can choose to post a thread of their own and select to display it globally or to a certain range (in miles) that the post should be visible from the users current location. If a user visits a thread they will see any replies/messages that were posted in response to that post and can submit their own response as well either as anonymous or under their chosen username.
